# Pokemon-Data-Pipeline

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to strengthen my skills in data engineering, analytics, and Python web development (Streamlit).

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic ETL pipeline using Pokémon data. We extract data from the PokeAPI, transform it using Python (with Pandas), and load it into a PostgreSQL database. After the ETL process, we use Streamlit to display and interact with the data. Users can search for different Pokémon and their details. Additionally, we plan to implement a chatbot using LangChain that users can interact with, such as asking: "Give me 3 fire-type Pokémon."

# Project Status

## Extraction

The API connection has been successfully established, and the necessary data has been retrieved
